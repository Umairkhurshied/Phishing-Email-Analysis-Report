# Phishing-Email-Analysis-Report
In this task, I analyzed a sample phishing email to understand common phishing tactics and improve my email threat analysis skills. I started by obtaining a basic phishing email and examined the senderâ€™s email address for spoofing. I checked the email headers using an online analyzer and identified various discrepancies. I also looked for suspicious links, mismatched URLs, urgent or threatening language, and grammatical errors in the email body. Based on this, I summarized the phishing traits found in the email. This exercise helped me gain practical awareness of how phishing emails are crafted and what red flags to watch for.
