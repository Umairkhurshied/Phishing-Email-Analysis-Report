# Phishing Email Analysis Report

For this task, I picked a sample phishing email that looked like a security alert from a bank. The goal was to analyze it and identify signs that made it suspicious.

## Sender Address Check
At first glance, the email looked like it came from "alerts@securebank.com", but when I checked the real address, it was actually something like "xjf93@unrelateddomain.com".
That mismatch is a clear sign of spoofing — the sender is pretending to be someone else.

## Header Analysis
I copied the email headers and analyzed them using an online tool (mxtoolbox). The SPF and DKIM checks both failed, and the servers that handled the email didn’t match the real domain.
This confirmed the email wasn’t sent from the actual bank servers.

## Suspicious Links
The email had a “Click here to verify” link that looked like a secure URL at first, but hovering over it showed a completely different domain: something like `http://secure-login.bank-update.info`.
That’s definitely suspicious. There were no attachments in this one, but the link alone was enough of a red flag.

## Urgent Tone and Language
The message said stuff like “Your account will be suspended within 24 hours” and “Immediate action required.” That kind of urgent language is used a lot in phishing emails to scare users into clicking quickly.

## URL Mismatches
There were also mismatched URLs — for example, the text showed `www.bank.com`, but the actual link behind it was pointing to `http://malicious-site.ru/login`.

## Grammar and Spelling Issues
I noticed a few errors in the text, like “You’re acount has been compromised” and “Click hear to resolve issue.” These kinds of mistakes are typical in phishing attempts.

## Summary of Red Flags Found
- Fake sender address (spoofing)
- Email headers failed SPF and DKIM checks
- Suspicious/mismatched links
- Urgent and threatening language
- Grammar and spelling errors

## Final Thoughts
This exercise gave me a good understanding of how phishing emails work and what signs to look out for. It was helpful in improving my email security awareness and learning how to analyze suspicious messages more confidently.
